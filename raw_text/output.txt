United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson,: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid when you look at what‚Äôs happening in Bucha, the revelations that we are seeing from what Putin has

Rubbish school dinners and Boris Johnson. The public get what the public want.  The real story is that Boris Johnson was booed. This was how the British and other international media reported it.

He isn\'t though. "ripped off by the economic system and abandoned by the government."  It doesn\'t say "THIS [Boris Johnson] government". So, "by the government" can be read here as "by the state". The economic system is neoliberalism where the state refuses social responsibility. BUT, did you appreciate the booing of Boris Johnson?After the booing Boris Johnson will do this: 1. Announce he‚Äôs having another baby. 2. Go 
to a hospital and take pictures talking to doctors and nurses. 3. Disappear for 2 weeks saying he‚Äôs got covid. 4. Go on a business trip and come back empty handed.Can‚Äôt get over just how much I dislike Boris Johnson for ruining a once in a lifetime opportunity to remake the UK economy. He‚Äôs such an absolute dolt. Important lesson though ‚Äî you can only welcome so many traditional voters from the other party before becoming them, it seems. Would‚Äôve been an absolute disaster.
